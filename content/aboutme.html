<h2>My approach</h2>
<hr>
<p>Personal development is a lifetime process, and this development transects different phases of
our lives and different contexts. I enjoy acting as a facilitator for people, guiding them through
this learning process.
I have been working for 15 years, showing individuals and groups different ways to reflect on
themselves. I offer seminars and consultation sessions that are tailored to align with your goals,
desires, ways of working, and expectations. I will help you discover your own path, one that is
best suited to you, and guide you down it—always keeping the goal in sight.
I have worked as a coordinator for numerous projects and initiatives, and I have held a number
of different positions. Through these experiences, I gained in-depth knowledge of how to design,
manage, and evaluate projects, as well as how to provide guidance for people performing
volunteer work, working in networks, public relations, and fundraising.
I can build on all these experiences to help me in guiding and supporting your processes. I know
and understand workflows and processes, structures, and teamwork. Likewise, I am capable of
quickly grasping them, enabling me to put myself in your shoes, so to speak.
