<h1>Training/continuing education</h1>
<p>I have been devising, planning, and conducting seminars and workshops on diversity, conflict
management/resolution, gender, (im)migration, identity, and global learning and cooperation.
I prepare all training courses and continuing education classes tailored specifically to the target
group, basing my preparations on the number of participants, goals for the training, and
timeframes.
I offer training courses and continuing education classes on:

<h2 id="link1">Preparing and conducting workshops</h2>
<p>This course focuses on people who, through their regular job or for a volunteer position, want to
learn how to prepare a workshop and conduct it themselves.
A professionally run workshop needs appropriate advance preparations: How do I concentrate
on my target group? How can I establish realistic goals for the workshop? How do I select an
appropriate methodology or module(s) of methods? Which method(s) match my workshop’s
needs? Where do I begin? What things should I pay closer attention to when conducting my
workshop? How do I prepare/moderate the discussions, enabling participants/attendees to
pursue the goals of the workshop?
Participants will learn about how to prepare and conduct a workshop during this two-day
seminar. In addition, they will also be given the opportunity to try out the material they have
learned. Participants will learn a number of different methods stemming from various areas and
have the opportunity to test their skills in preparing a workshop using the following aspects:
How to prepare a workshop that concentrates on the goals of the target group
How to select topics
How to set goals
How to prepare a schedule
How to conduct a workshop
How to develop and moderate discussions
How to promote diversity in the group

<h2 id="link2">Conflict management/resolution</h2>
<p>My concept for training people in conflict management and resolution focuses on several target
groups. It is intended to help people who, through their regular job or for a volunteer position,
are placed in situations where conflict ensues. It is also meant to support those who come into
contact with difficult interpersonal situations.
Conflicts can provide opportunities. I will support the participants in their respective position to learn from conflict situations, to express their needs, and to recognize and acknowledge the
other person(s)/side(s).
I will apply various methods and models used in conflict management and resolution, depending
on the specific need. Participants will learn to react properly in specific situations, and they can
practice them in the seminar.

<h2 id="link3">Gender training</h2>
<p>Gender and its structures have an impact on us and how we are and (re)act. By being able to
reflect on our experiences, on how we view gender, we can better empower ourselves,
contributing to improved cooperation in teams and organizational structures.
This seminar is directed at a wide range of target groups that want to deal with this broad topic.
Take a few examples from my professional career:
- Workshop for researchers promoting reflection on gender-based assumptions made in
research projects and their impact on the participating researchers’ own projects
- On-the-job workshop promoting reflection on relationships between genders and
interpersonal relationships in institutions
- Workshop for refugees on the relationships between genders in the context of their
respective home countries and of Germany

<h2 id="link4">Diversity</h2>
<p>My seminar on diversity is directed at:
- people who want to hone their awareness of diversity in society
- groups and teams who want to improve their actions with regard to diversity
- companies that want to design their structures to be more aware of diversity in the
workplace
- people who have experienced discrimination first-hand and want to better empower
themselves to deal with those situations in the future
I design my diversity offering as long-term processes in order to ensure sustainable results.
Send me an email if you want to receive more information on how to design and prepare
training courses and continuing education measures. I would also be happy to send you an offer
for a specific course.</p>
