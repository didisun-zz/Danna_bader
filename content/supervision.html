<h2>Supervision and reflection on practical experiences</h2>
<p>
When I refer to reflection on practical experiences, I am addressing people, groups of people at
work, teams, or special interest groups who want to reflect on their situation at work or in a
volunteer position and/or want to change specific conditions or work methods.
Reflection on practical experiences can help:
<ul>
<li>in expanding perspectives</li>
<li>in managing conflicts</li>
<li>in analyzing situations</li>
<li>in improving communication</li>
<li>in discussing conflicts and providing guidance</li>
<li>in improving cooperation and cooperation within the context of a team</li>
<li>in adapting structures to specific needs</li>
</ul>
